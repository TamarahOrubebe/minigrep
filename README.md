Testing what I have learnt so far to build a mini version of the grep tool in Rust
The grep tool basically takes in two arguments which are a file we want to search, and a string we want to search for. So my mini grep program has to be able to do the following:
1. It has to be able to read command line arguments
2. It has to be able to read from the file passed in as an argument
